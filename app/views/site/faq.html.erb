        BCA:
        BNI:

        I'll be glad to help build the converter for you! All I need is a sample of the bank's statement - you can remove personal information (name, account no) from it. Please open an issue in <a href="https://github.com/sarahsau/indoynab">Github</a> and share a sample of the bank statement that need to be converted.
